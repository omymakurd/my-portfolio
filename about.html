                <p>
                    I'm Omyma Nabil AlKurd, a passionate Palestinian programmer with a solid academic background in
                    Information Systems, Programming, and Databases. I'm currently expanding my technical skills by
                    participating in a Full Stack Development Bootcamp.
                    I have hands-on experience in web development using ASP.NET and desktop application development with
                    C#, in addition to strong capabilities in IT support, system analysis, and database management.
                    Working with both local and international organizations has enriched my skills and adaptability,
                    enabling me to provide effective and innovative technical solutions.
                    I'm driven by a desire to be part of the modern tech industry and to create impactful digital
                    solutions.
